## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript DOM manipulation

### What I learned

On this project, I learnt how to validate forms with JavaScript and stop a page from reloading automatically.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:



```js
function keepBorder (event) {

event.preventDefault();

}

```



### Continued development

Still need to add mobile views to brush up my media queries skills.

### Useful resources

Helped me for understand DOM manipulation and how to make the webpage somewhat interactive. The tutorial was very easy and explanatory.
